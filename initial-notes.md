Some kind of hangman game
With categories? (90's song titles, pokemon, some kind of celebrities)
Teams? Ask for name or team name. 

How to make it 2 player?
Take in turns - whoever guesses correctly first wins

Some kind of cool animation, for the hangman. 

Different themes?

Ability to pick themes, or else enter your own word.

Array of letters appear as buttons - they vanish from the 'pool' or black out when clicked (correct or incorrect)

Hangman but not.
Build something? Destroy something? 
Something developer realted? 

Webpage starts breaking
Timed?
Being under some kind of pressure?

Hangman Game Logic:

1. User is asked if they want to input their own words or have them randomly generated
2. If randomly generated, then choose a category (maybe, maybe not)
3. Single player or multi player (can have x amount of players?)
4. Once word and teams have been decided, page loads with correct _ _ / _ _ etc.
5. (Need to determine visual hangman metaphor)
6. Buttons of letters are available to click (select) as guesses
7. If correct, the letters appear in the _ _ / _ _
8. They are then removed/faded out of the available letters
9. If a player/team guesses the correct letter, they get to play again
10. After a guess, there is an option to guess the word
11. If the 'hangman' is completed, before the word is guessed, it is game over 
12. The score is kept and displayed (possible to reset?)
13. There should be a possibility to return to the menu at any point
